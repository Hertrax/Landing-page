# landing-page

  This is a landing page based off  treetwear and brutalistic design aesthetic. 
  
  Here i'll be using the aforementiones things to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and a bit of flexbox.

  Personally I dont really like what i did to the esign but ig this is the best i could've done. I'll keep learning more stuff and ,ake it even prettier because well css is HHUUGGEE.

  plan to make thiskinda a portfolio site maybe.
